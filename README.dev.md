## Dependencies

## Ideas

- levels
- more starting bullets in earlier levels than later levels
- fewer spawned balloons in earlier levels than later levels
- earn special munitions like proximity fuse, cluster, airstrike, helicopter gunship, suicide a-bomb
- wind effect, layered
- small random variation in balloon's x and y
- hiscore table
- add objects that you can't hit, e.g. birds
- move FPS label
